# Marks To Check Pass Or Fail

a) Create a class named Marks. Marks class contains four instance variables:

  1) id (String)
  2) quizMark (double)
  3) midMark (double)
  4) finalMark (double)

b) Write a parameterized constructor for Marks class which initializes all the instance variables using this keyword.

c) Write a method passedOrNot which calculates the total mark of a student by adding quiz, mid and final marks.

d) Then, if the student’s total mark is greater or equal to 55, print “passed” in the console. Otherwise print “failed” in the console. Method passedOrNot should not have any parameters.

e) Create a class called Main and write the main method inside the class. Create Marks objects in the main method with appropriate parameters. Call the passedOrNot method using the objects you created.
