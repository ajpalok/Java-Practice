# GUI Calcutor

You have to build a calculator that looks like this:

```txt
 ______________________
|                      |
|   -----     -----    |
|   | 1 |     | 2 |    |
|   -----     -----    |
|                      |
|   -----     -----    |
|   | + |     | - |    |
|   -----     -----    |
|                      |
|                      |
|    ------------      |
|   |      3     |     |
|    ------------      |

```

There will be two text fields that will take input. There will be two buttons - “+” and “-”. If “+” is
pressed, the output label will show the added value of the two text fields. Same for “-”
